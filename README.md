# AlgoVisualizer 
It is mandatory for a CS student to learn various algorithms. Every algorithm does some particular task following some steps. For example, sorting algorithms sort data in different ways. Vizualizing the concept and working principles of an algorithm may help one to have a better understaning and to learn it in a very short time. Fo this, I was motivated to develop 'AlgoVisualizer'.

Here, I have implemented '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">Bubble Sort</a>' algorithm.
