# AlgoVisualizer 
It is mandatory for a CS student to learn various algorithms. Every algorithm does some particular task following some steps. For example, sorting algorithms sort data in different ways. Vizualizing the concept and working principles of an algorithm may help one to have a better understaning and to learn it in a very short time. Fo this, I was motivated to develop 'AlgoVisualizer'.

I have implemented '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">Bubble Sort</a>' algorithm.

Here, clicking "Bubble Sort" button, you will get a window to input some data. Data must be numeric. Only a space should be given to split two integer.

As this only extracts the concept of bubble sort, for better visualization maximum input length is six and requested value of any integer is less than 1000 and greater than -100. Clicking "sort" button will take to visualization window. 

In this window, Input data are shown in the top row. Next N-1 rows denotes every iteration, <i>ith</i> of them denotes <i>ith</i> ineration. (N is number of data)

In current iteration, ovals
